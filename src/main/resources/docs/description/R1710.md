# inconsistent-return-statements (R1710)
*Either all return statements in a function should return an expression,
or none of them should.* According to PEP8, if any return statement
returns an expression, any return statements where no value is returned
should explicitly state this as return None, and an explicit return
statement should be present at the end of the function (if reachable)
