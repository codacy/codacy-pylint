# subprocess-popen-preexec-fn (W1509)
*Using preexec\_fn keyword which may be unsafe in the presence of
threads* The preexec\_fn parameter is not safe to use in the presence of
threads in your application. The child process could deadlock before
exec is called. If you must use it, keep it trivial! Minimize the number
of libraries you call
into.https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html\#popen-constructor
