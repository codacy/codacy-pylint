# c-extension-no-member (I1101)
*%s %r has no %r member%s, but source is unavailable. Consider adding
this module to extension-pkg-whitelist if you want to perform analysis
based on run-time introspection of living objects.* Used when a variable
is accessed for non-existent member of C extension. Due to
unavailability of source static analysis is impossible, but it may be
performed by introspecting living objects in run-time.
