# trailing-comma-tuple (R1707)
*Disallow trailing comma tuple* In Python, a tuple is actually created
by the comma symbol, not by the parentheses. Unfortunately, one can
actually create a tuple by misplacing a trailing comma, which can lead
to potential weird bugs in your code. You should always use parentheses
explicitly for creating a tuple.
