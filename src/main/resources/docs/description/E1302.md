# mixed-format-string (E1302)
*Mixing named and unnamed conversion specifiers in format string* Used
when a format string contains both named (e.g. \'%(foo)d\') and unnamed
(e.g. \'%d\') conversion specifiers. This is also used when a named
conversion specifier contains \* for the minimum field width and/or
precision.
