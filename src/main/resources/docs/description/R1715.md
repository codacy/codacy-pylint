# consider-using-get (R1715)
*Consider using dict.get for getting values from a dict if a key is
present or a default if not* Using the builtin dict.get for getting a
value from a dictionary if a key is present or a default if not, is
simpler and considered more idiomatic, although sometimes a bit slower
