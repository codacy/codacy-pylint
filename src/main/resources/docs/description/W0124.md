# confusing-with-statement (W0124)
*Following \"as\" with another context manager looks like a tuple.*
Emitted when a with statement component returns multiple values and uses
name binding with as only for a part of those values, as in with ctx()
as a, b. This can be misleading, since it\'s not clear if the context
manager returns a tuple or if the node without a name binding is another
context manager.
