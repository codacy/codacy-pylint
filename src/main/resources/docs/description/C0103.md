Used when a name doesn't doesn't fit the naming convention associated to its type (constant, variable, class…).
When everyone writing the code follows the same conventions the code becomes much more readable.

The naming conventions are defined with a regular expression, and the naming convention is satisfied if the name matches the regular expression. The regular expression syntax is the normal Python regular expression syntax, as used in Python raw strings (e.g. r"abc").

Options can be used to override the default regular expression associated to each type.
You can check the a table with the options and their default values in the link bellow.
