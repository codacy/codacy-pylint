# Codacy Pylint

This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to have [Pylint](http://www.pylint.org/) support.
You can also create a docker to integrate the tool and language of your choice!
See the [codacy-engine-scala-seed](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-engine-scala-seed) repository for more information.

## Usage

You can create the docker by doing:

  ```bash
  docker build -t codacy-pylint-python3:latest .
  ```

The docker is ran with the following command:

  ```bash
  docker run -it -v $srcDir:/src codacy-pylint-python3:latest
  ```

## Generate Docs

 1. Update the version in `docs/patterns.json`

 2. Run the DocGenerator:

    ```bash
    sbt "doc-generator/run"
    ```

## Test

We use the [codacy-plugins-test](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-plugins-test) to test our external tools integration.
You can follow the instructions there to make sure your tool is working as expected.
