# redefined-argument-from-local (R1704)

*Redefining argument with the local name %r* Used when a local name is
redefining an argument, which might suggest a potential error. This is
taken in account only for a handful of name binding operations, such as
for iteration, with statement assignment and exception handler
assignment.
