# misplaced-bare-raise (E0704)
*The raise statement is not inside an except clause* Used when a bare
raise is not used inside an except clause. This generates an error,
since there are no active exceptions to be reraised. An exception to
this rule is represented by a bare raise inside a finally clause, which
might work, as long as an exception is raised inside the try block, but
it is nevertheless a code smell that must not be relied upon.
