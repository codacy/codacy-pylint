# eq-without-hash (W1641)
*Implementing \_\_eq\_\_ without also implementing \_\_hash\_\_* Used
when a class implements \_\_eq\_\_ but not \_\_hash\_\_. In Python 2,
objects get object.\_\_hash\_\_ as the default implementation, in Python
3 objects get None as their default \_\_hash\_\_ implementation if they
also implement \_\_eq\_\_.
