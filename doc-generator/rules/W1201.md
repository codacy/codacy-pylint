# logging-not-lazy (W1201)
*Specify string format arguments as logging function parameters* Used
when a logging statement has a call form of \"logging.\<logging
method\>(format\_string % (format\_args\...))\". Such calls should leave
string interpolation to the logging method itself and be written
\"logging.\<logging method\>(format\_string, format\_args\...)\" so that
the program may avoid incurring the cost of the interpolation in those
cases in which no message will be logged. For more, see
<http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0282/>.
