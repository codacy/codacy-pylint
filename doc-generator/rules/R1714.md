# consider-using-in (R1714)
*Consider merging these comparisons with \"in\" to %r* To check if a
variable is equal to one of many values,combine the values into a tuple
and check if the variable is contained \"in\" it instead of checking for
equality against each of the values.This is faster and less verbose.
