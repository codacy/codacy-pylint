# logging-fstring-interpolation (W1203)
*Use % formatting in logging functions and pass the % parameters as
arguments* Used when a logging statement has a call form of
\"logging.method(f\"\...\"))\". Such calls should use % formatting
instead, but leave interpolation to the logging function by passing the
parameters as arguments.
